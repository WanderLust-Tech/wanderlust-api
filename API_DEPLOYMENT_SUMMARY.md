## Key Features Implemented

### 🔨 Automated .NET Build Process
```bash
dotnet clean → dotnet restore → dotnet publish
```
- Supports both Debug and Release configurations
- Automatic dependency restoration
- Build validation and error reporting
- Output optimization for deployment

### 📤 Intelligent FTP Deployment
- **Backup Creation:** Automatic backup of existing deployment
- **File Filtering:** Excludes debug symbols, logs, and sensitive files
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time upload progress and file counting
- **Validation:** Post-deployment integrity checks

### ⚙️ IIS Configuration
- **Automatic web.config generation** for ASP.NET Core hosting
- **Production environment settings** optimization
- **Error handling configuration** for production
- **Security headers** and request filtering

### 🔍 Change Detection
- **Project file monitoring** for intelligent deployment triggers
- **GitHub Actions integration** with commit analysis
- **Local file change detection** for development deployments

### 🛡️ Security & Validation
- **Environment variable protection** (credentials not in code)
- **File filtering** (no debug symbols or sensitive files)
- **Deployment validation** (ensures main DLL and configuration exist)
- **Backup management** (automatic rollback capability)

## Environment Variables Configuration

### Required Settings
```env
API_FTP_HOST=your-ftp-host.com
API_FTP_USER=your-ftp-username
API_FTP_PASSWORD=your-ftp-password
```

### Optional Settings
```env
API_FTP_PORT=21
API_FTP_SECURE=false
API_FTP_REMOTE_PATH=/api
BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Release
API_LOCAL_BUILD_PATH=./bin/Release/net8.0/publish
API_PROJECT_FILE=./WanderlustApi.csproj
```

## Available Commands

### Primary Commands
- `npm run deploy` - Full deployment (build + upload)
- `npm run test-connection` - Test FTP connection and permissions

### Build Commands
- `npm run build` - Build API (debug)

## Integration with Frontend Workflow

The API deployment system now perfectly matches the frontend's deployment approach:

### Shared Characteristics
- **FTP-based deployment** with basic-ftp library
- **Environment variable configuration** with .env files
- **Automated build processes** before deployment
- **Backup and validation** systems
- **GitHub Actions compatibility**
- **Progress reporting** and error handling

### Platform-Specific Optimizations
- **.NET build process** with dotnet CLI integration
- **IIS configuration** with automatic web.config generation
- **Assembly filtering** to exclude debug symbols
- **ASP.NET Core hosting** optimization

## Security Considerations

### Credential Protection
- ✅ Environment variables for all sensitive data
- ✅ .env files excluded from version control
- ✅ GitHub Secrets integration for CI/CD

### File Security
- ✅ Debug symbols filtered out (*.pdb)
- ✅ Development configurations excluded
- ✅ Log files and temporary files filtered
- ✅ Production-optimized web.config

### Deployment Security
- ✅ FTPS support for encrypted transfers
- ✅ Backup creation before deployment
- ✅ Validation checks for deployment integrity
- ✅ Error handling without credential exposure

## Next Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your FTP credentials
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install
```

### 2. Test Connection
```bash
npm run test-connection
```

### 3. First Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### 4. GitHub Actions (Optional)
- Add FTP credentials to repository secrets
- Configure workflow for automatic deployment on API changes

## Success Metrics

✅ **Deployment Automation:** Complete build-to-deployment pipeline
✅ **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error detection and reporting
✅ **Security:** Credential protection and file filtering
✅ **Validation:** Post-deployment integrity checks
✅ **Documentation:** Complete setup and troubleshooting guide
✅ **Integration:** Matches frontend deployment workflow
✅ **Production Ready:** IIS configuration and optimization

The API now has a production-ready, automated deployment system that provides the same level of reliability and ease-of-use as the frontend deployment, completing the unified deployment strategy for the Wanderlust platform.
